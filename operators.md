# Operators

## What is an operator ?

An operator is something that takes one or more values (expressions) and yields another value, so that the construction itself becomes an expression.

## Types of operators

Arithmetic operators - used to perform mathematical operations on operands

Relational operators - used for comparison of two values

Logical operators - used to combine two or more conditiond or to compliment the evaluation of the original condition in consideration

Bitwise operators - used to perform the bitwise operation

Assignment operators

Ternary operators

## Precedence

Operator precedence determines which operation is performed first in an expression with more than one operator. Operator precedence in Perl is similar to that of regular arithmetic operators.

The operator with higher precedence is executed first in an expression.

## Associativity

Associativity is used when two operators of the same precedence appear in an expression

### Left associativity

Left associativity occurs when an expression is evaluated from left to right.

### Right associativity

Right associativity occurs when an expression is evaluated from right to left. Like most programming languages, = and print in Perl have right associativity. Similarly, combined assignment operators (+=, -=, \*=, \=) have the right associativity.
