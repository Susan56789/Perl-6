# Variables

A variable is named piece of computer memory to hold some program data.

We declare variables using $ sign followed by its name e.g., $myVar

## Escape characters

escape characters are used to achieve a specific functionality

e.g.,

\n represents a new line or line break

## Data types

There are different data types available i.e

Boolean

Integer

Float

Array

String

unlike other languages, Perl does not require defining variables along with a specific data type

The type of a varable is picked based on the value assigned to it.

## Array

An array is like a list of values (similar or different data types)

We use @ to initiate an array with values enclosed in () pair of parenthesis

## variable Variables

We can access data through dynamic variable names.

The name of a variable can be stored in another variable allowing it to be accessed dynamically.

Such variables are known as VARIABLE VARABLES

To turn a variable into a VARIABLE VARIABLE, you put * in front of your variable.
